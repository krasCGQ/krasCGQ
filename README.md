## Welcome to my profile! Or...maybe it is.

A team member of [AIM ROM](https://github.com/AIMROM) and TeamHorizon's [XenonHD](https://github.com/TeamHorizon) under some sort of roles (both are memories now), and part of [devscapes](https://github.com/RaphielGang).

* My GitHub profile only hosts personal projects that don't belong to any organization I have created, such as `dotfiles`, `scripts`, etc.
* For Android device/kernel-related projects, please check out [KudProject](https://github.com/orgs/KudProject/repositories) repositories.
* For my Arch Linux PKGBUILDs, please take a look at my [archlinux-kud](https://github.com/archlinux-kud) profile instead.
* Otherwise, check on any public organizations at the bottom of my profile on Desktop site if you are looking for something else.

I'm currently publicly reachable on Twitter and [Telegram](https://t.me/lmaoicon) (preferrably in [my lounge](https://t.me/KudNetworkChat) as I often ignore PMs), English and Bahasa only.
